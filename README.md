1. The 000.xlsx is the most important file that you should not change the name of this file.
2. This program could only read sheet1 in the Excel. Please do not add information to other sheets.
3. The data structure of 000.xlsx is:

| (Picture filename) | (Latin name) | (Common name) | (Latin required) |
|------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 001 | Polystichum acrostichoides | Christmas fern | 0 |
| 002 | Pteridium aquilinum | bracken fern | 1 |

PS: 
+ 0 == Latin names don't need to recite, 1 == Latin Name required. If you just want to identify plants rather than remembering their Latin names, just put zeros in that column.
+ The first row should not be put into the sheet(just tell you the meaning of each column), please start with your picture names in the first line directly.
+ Picture names in the sheet must the same as picture names in the Data folder.
